Random Canvas is a generative art algorithm which places lines, curves, dots, and rectangles, all within a color palette, on a background.

Examples of Random Canvas include:
- the online sliding transitions between art pieces at 589designs.com
- the Scriptable script which displays new random minimalist generative art periodically
- the nft set at fxhash.xyz which also incorporates p5js and p5-squiggles for more realism

To use the Scriptable script, simply copy the code in the script file and then paste that code into a Scriptable script which you then run in a widget.
